Andrea did a fantastic job listing and selling our primary house. She had the photographers, appraisal,reports all completed within the 1st week. She was diligent in advertising our house each week in several agencies and sending to various neighborhoods. Our house received enormous amount of interested buyers instantly. She took several offers and it was sold very fast. She represented us and gave us total attention. I totally recommend Andrea Hesselein to be the best realtor anyone selling their house to get great representation.
